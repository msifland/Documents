Step 1 - Decompressing = DAT (sparse data) -> EXT4 (raw image)
Download sdat2img from here: https://github.com/xpirt/sdat2img
Or check the scripts folder to see if you already have it and move it to decompressed rom folder.

We're now using sdat2img binary, the usage is very simple:
./sdat2img <transfer_list> <system_new_file> <system_ext4>
- <transfer_list> = input, system.transfer.list from rom zip
- <system_new_file> = input, system.new.dat from rom zip
- <system_ext4> = output ext4 raw image file
and a quick example:

CODE:
./sdat2img.py system.transfer.list system.new.dat system.img

by running this command you will get as output the file my_new_system.img which is the raw ext4 image.


Step 2 - Decompress EXT4 (raw image) -> OUTPUT folder -> Compress EXT4 (raw image)
Now we need to mount or ext4 raw image into an output folder so we can see apks/jars etc.
To do this we need to type this command:
Create a folder called output

CODE:
sudo mount -t ext4 -o loop system.img output/

As you can see there is a new folder called output which we can edit/modify/delete your files (not able to? see here)
