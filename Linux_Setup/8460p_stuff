All tests was done on clean installation of Linux distribution Ubuntu 11.04 natty (without external repositories/programs).

Ambient Light Sensor

Enable:

echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/als
Disable:

echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/als
Wireless button

Wireless button is controled by HW, so no driver is needed. For handling events generated by this button (e.g when press show info on screen), is needed proper maping to KEY_WLAN (238) in kernel (default is for unknow key):

setkeycodes e078 238
Ambient button

Fn+F11 (Ambient button) is badly mapped in kernel to KEY_TOUCHPAD_OFF (193). For remaping to KEY_PROG1 (148) which can be configured in Gnome/KDE for enabling/disabling sensor with commands above:

setkeycodes e033 148
Brightness buttons

For controlling brightness on notebook with Radeon card is needed these kernel patches:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-July/025535.html
On notebooks with Intel card there are no problems.

If brightness keys on radeon notebook with above patches not working, change brightness with this command (N=1..254):

echo N > /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl/brightness
Accelerometer

In linux kernel is recognized as joystick device with 3 axes and 0 buttons. Tested with KDE4 systemsettings joystick configuration. Application can read state throw file /dev/input/js0

Temperature sensors

Reading temperature can be done throw sysfs (in thousends degress of Celsius):

head /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/temp*_input
Or program sensors from package lm-sensors:

sensors
On graphics card AMD Radeon HD 6470M

Autodetected with open source driver radeon. Nothing more steps needed.

On processor

Need manualy load kernel module coretemp:

modprobe coretemp
