-To install linux on to a flash drive, simply download the live.iso distro you want, boot into it and insert you flash drive to install to and got through the install process.
	IMPORTANT: INSTALL GRUB TO /dev/sdX(usb drive), not to /dev/sda(main hard drive)
-Then reboot to main machine and reinstall grub on usb:
	sudo apt install grub(2) /dev/sdX
	sudo grub-install /dev/sdX
	sudo update-grub /dev/sdX
	-If no boot and in grub rescue:
	ls
		shows: (hd0),(hd0,msdos1)(hd0,msdos2)
		Pick correct one.
	set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub
		If wrong one, error will display.
	insmod normal
	normal
	-Should reboot to OS.
	-Open terminal and type:
	lsblk
		to see what partition to install to.
	sudo update-grub
	sudo grub-install /dev/sdX
	-Reboot to usb.
	
-If not grub rescue
	-Boot back into live cd, open terminal and type:
		sudo su
	-Mount your normal system partition. X is the drive letter. Y is the partition number:
	-Substitute the correct partition: sda1, sdb5, etc.
		mount /dev/sdXY /mnt
	-Example 1: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
	
	-Mount the critical virtual filesystems. Run the following as a single command:
		for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do mount -B $i /mnt$i; done
		
	-Chroot into your normal system device:
		chroot /mnt
		
	-Reinstall GRUB 2 (substitute the correct device with sda, sdb, etc. Do not specify a partition number):
		grub-install /dev/sdX
		
	-Recreate the GRUB 2 menu file (grub.cfg)
		update-grub
		
	-Exit chroot and Reboot.
		exit
		sudo reboot

-To install a grub entry for and live.iso install onto the same drive:
	-Download live.iso of choice
	-Put it into a folder on the main usb linux install /home/msifland/<some_folder>/
	-Then open this file:
		sudo subl /etc/grub.d/grub.cfg
	Add this to the bottom of the file:

---For Debian Live.iso Live environment only, no install.
### Customer Entry ###
exec tail -n +3 $0

menuentry "Debian Live(no install)" {
		set isofile="/home/msifland/iso/debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-mate.iso"
        set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
		loopback loop (hd0,1)$isofile
        linux (loop)/live/vmlinuz-4.9.0-7-amd64 boot=live iso-scan/filename=$isofile findiso=$isofile
        initrd (loop)/live/initrd-4.9.0-7-amd64
}
### End Custom Entry ###

---For Debian installer
-Download full live image from here(netinstall images do not work):
	https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
-Check name and download hd-media initrd.gz and vmlinuz from same name as above from here:
	http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/<<<<<distro>>>>>/main/installer-amd64/current/images/hd-media/
-Download firmware from: 
	http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/<<<<<<distro>>>>>>/current/
-Put all theses files in a folder on USB debian install: /home/msifland/iso/
-Add the entry below to /boot/grub/grub.cfg for booting.
-After booting run initial startup and go through steps and do full scan for .iso image.
-Select correct .iso image in folder listed above.
-Menu will ask for firmware disk to be inserted at this point.
-Push alt+f2
-Mount firmware:
	mount --bind /hd-media/home/msifland/iso/firmware /media
-Resume install by pressing alt+f1, and should go smoothly from here.

		-A few things to make note of here on this entry.
			1. The title of what you want it to say is the first line in quotes.	
			2. The second line sets the path of the file you have on your system. It will boot straight from the .iso
			3. The third line is what mounts the .iso.
			4. The fourth and fifth lines tells it what to look for inside the .iso file. You may have to open the .iso file to see the file names and make sure the are correct. in peticular the 'vmlinuz' and 'initrd.lz' files.

-To make drive last longer disable journal. Boot to a linux machine, plug in the usb drive you have installed linux on and type this in terminal, obviously changing the 'X' and 'Y' to what it should be:
		tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdXY

####################################
-Alternate method, not as reliable.

	-Then open this file(if it doesn't exist, then create it and make sure permissions are set to executable):
		sudo subl /etc/grub.d/40_custom
		-Insert this into the file:

#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change the 'exec tail' line above.

menuentry "Mate 18.04 Live-ISO" {
	set isofile="/home/msifland/mate_iso/ubuntu-mate-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso"
	loopback loop (hd0,1)$isofile
	linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject
	initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
}

		-After adding this to the file and saving it, open terminal and run:
			sudo grub-mkconfig
				-Let it generate, it will take a couple minutes.
			 	-Open /boot/grub/grub.cfg and remove entries not needed. Usually stuff between 30_os_prober. Also make sure that 40_custom entry is there as well, usually toward the bottom.
		-Then your menu entry should be in the grub menu and should boot to a live cd environment.
