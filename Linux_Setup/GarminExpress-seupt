Linux Package Requirements:
wine-devel Note:3.19 or higher
winetricks
Installation Steps
First we start by creating a wineprefix and installing our prerequisites from terminal:
	WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=/home/$USER/GarminExpress winetricks dotnet452 vcrun2010 corefonts
	WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=/home/$USER/GarminExpress winetricks win7
		Note: You will be prompted during the setup for .NET installation just hit next and finish. Also, I like to seperate win7 after the prerequisites are setup to make sure the wineprefix runs in Windows 7 mode.

With that out of the way we need to download and install our GarminExpress.exe Setup executable. I downloaded mine from https://www.garmin.com/en-US/software/express

Run the GarminExpress.exe file in our wine prefix:
	WINEPREFIX=/home/$USER/GarminExpress wine explorer /desktop=garmin,1366x768 /home/$USER/Downloads/GarminExpress.exe
		Note: If you downloaded the GarminExpress.exe to another location replace it above

Modify your shortcut to be the following command:
	WINEPREFIX=/home/msifland/GarminExpress wine explorer /desktop=garmin,1366x768 '/home/msifland/GarminExpress/drive_c/Program Files/Garmin/Express/express.exe'
		Upon Launch you should see this screen which should recognize your Garmin device
