Original way:
Copy contents of sabermod-prebuilts folder to coresponding system folder.

OR:

There's a easy way to use the toolchains barebone with no rom modifications and won't require you installing anything into your system. This is a one time step although you may need to download new updates for the prebuilts from time to time.

Note that if you use vendor/sm in your rom and inline kernel building you won't needed to do this.

First download the prebuilt libs from:
http://sabermod.com/Prebuilt-libs%20%28DEV%20ONLY%29/

Extract it somewhere like your home directory.

Next edit the file ~/.bashrc
gedit ~/.bashrc

Put these on the bottom. Or if your Linux distro doesn't have a ~./ bashrc put these by themselves and it will still work.

SM_PREBUILTS=~/sabermod-prebuilts;
export LIBRARY_PATH=$SM_PREBUILTS/usr/lib:$SM_PREBUILTS/usr/lib/arm;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SM_PREBUILTS/usr/lib:$SM_PREBUILTS/usr/lib/arm;

For aarch64(arm64), replace arm with arm64 instead of arm in ~/.bashrc

Save and close the file.

Next run:
source ~/.bashrc;

Now you should have no issues compiling roms or kernels with the toolchains.﻿
